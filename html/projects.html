  <h3>Tower Defense Game</h3>
  <body>For the second half of my Junior Year, two of my classmates and I undertook an ambitious game project. We brainstormed many ideas but eventually settled on building a tower defense game in an industrial setting that involves you defending your factory from incoming hordes of enemies by constructing traps out of modular components. We all took on various programming tasks, and one of my teammates did all of the artwork. We used Github for source control to organize collaboration. We decided to use the Godot game engine because none of us had used it before, yet I had heard that it was good. As of so far, the game is still incomplete, but we continue to keep working on it over the summer and into next year until it is ready to be released into the world.</body>

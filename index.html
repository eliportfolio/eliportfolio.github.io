  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I am a Junior at CRLS who is very interested in computer science and game development. Before high school I was an entirely self taught programmer but now I have been taking classes to enhance my skills. I hope to eventually be a professional game developer focusing on gameplay programming.
